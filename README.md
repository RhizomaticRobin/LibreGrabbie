"What? Another esoteric 3D printed robot hand project that's basically just a toy/puppet/useless gizmo dohicky with 5 string motors? No! There's too many of those already!"

Well, here's where I might change your mind regarding that!

- **Flexible TPU palm mechanics**, allowing for hybrid soft robotics that allow for actual grasping around curved objects in comparison to current traditional robotic palm mechanics
- 16 motors allowing for **16 DOF hand dexerity**, 3 DOF for each finger and 4 DOF on the thumb
- Straightforward 3D printing and assembly with **only 5-10 3D printed parts** to be assembled together for more plug-and-play use dynamics
- Mechanics and electronics **entirely constrained** inside the palm, allowing for full end-effector modularity with all current and future robotic manipulators
- To utilize a modified L3-F-TOUCH sensing module for the fingers and palm and a stereo raspberry pi camera system for sensor fusion data to train reliable deep reinforcement learning

- (https://youtu.be/qtQ4rK66vlE?si=lcGbKkfz59pFsFFY **General Concept of touch module**) 
- (https://github.com/facebookresearch/tacto **Simulation environment to be possibly integrated**)
- **Upcoming trained AI/RL models** to be released allowing for automated grasping capabilities of generalized objects, which can be integrated with other reinforcement learning simulation projects involving Genesis and Issac Labs
- Alongside robotics applications, this can also serve as a **low-weight and cost-accessible hand for prosthetics design**, especially if built with worm drive gearboxes human-level gripping strength, also given with a customizable socket system (hopefully also full copyleft) for any given person
- **<$500 cost to build**, and **fully open source hardware and software** under the GPL 3.0 and CERN-OHL pair license :)
