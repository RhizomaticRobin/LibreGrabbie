# normal_hand
Normal hand, the normalist robot hand around, with *normal* human characteristics, like:

- Flexible TPU palm mechanics
- 16 motors allowing for 16 DOF in total, 3 DOF for each finger and 4 DOF on the thumb
- Straightforward 3D printing and assembly with only +5 main 3D printed parts to be assembled together
- Mechanics and electronics entirely constrained inside the palm, allowing for full end-effector modularity with all current and future robotic manipulators
- Upcoming trained AI/RL models to be released allowing for automated grasping capabilities of generalized objects that can be integrated with other reinforcement learning robotics projects involving Genesis and Issac Labs
- Less than 300 dollars material and assembly cost, and **fully open source hardware and software** under the GPL 3.0 and CERN-OHL pair license :)
